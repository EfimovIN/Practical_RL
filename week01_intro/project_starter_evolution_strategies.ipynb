    "Can you reproduce their success? You will have to implement evolutionary strategies and see how they work.\n",

    "This project is optional; has several milestones each worth a number of points [and swag].\n",
    "\n",
    "__Milestones:__\n",
    "* [10pts] Basic prototype of evolutionary strategies that works in one thread on CartPole\n",
    "* [+5pts] Modify the code to make them work in parallel\n",
    "* [+5pts] if you can run ES distributedly on at least two PCs\n",
    "* [+10pts] Apply ES to play Atari Pong at least better than random\n",
    "* [++] Additional points for all kinds of cool stuff besides milestones\n",
    "\n",
    "__Rules:__\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is __not a mandatory assignment__, but it's a way to learn some cool things if you're getting bored with default assignments.\n",
    "* Once you decided to take on this project, please tell any of course staff members so that we can help ypu if you get stuck.\n",
    "* There's a default implementation of ES in this [openai repo](https://github.com/openai/evolution-strategies-starter). It's okay to look there if you get stuck or want to compare your solutions, but each copy-pasted chunk of code should be understood thoroughly. We'll test that with questions."

    "* It would be very convenient later if you implemented a function that takes policy weights, generates a session and returns policy changes -- so that you could then run a bunch of them in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The simplest way you can do multiprocessing is to use [joblib](https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=joblib&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8)\n",
    "\n",
    "* For joblib, make sure random variables are independent in each job. Simply add `np.random.seed()` at the beginning of your \"job\" function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later once you got distributed, you may need a storage that gathers gradients from all workers. In such case we recommend [Redis](https://redis.io/) due to it's simplicity.\n",
